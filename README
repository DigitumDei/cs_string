CsString is a standalone library which provides unicode aware string support.

The CsBasicString class is a templated class which provides unicode aware string support. The encoding, such
as UTF-8 or UTF-16, is passed to the CsBasicString template. The following typedefs are provided for convenience.

   using CsString       = CsBasicString<utf8>;
   using CsString_utf8  = CsBasicString<utf8>;
   using CsString_utf16 = CsBasicString<utf16>;

To use CsString you will need a C++11 compiler and a C++11 standard library. 

The Autotools build system is used only for building and running the unit test suite. The 
library has been tested with clang sanitizer and a major code review.
